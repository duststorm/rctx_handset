A schematic and source code for a circuit to read joystick inputs (8 channels) and convert them into an rc pulse stream.

The software uses an arduino pro mini 16 MHz to read the anlog sensor values and convert into a PPM stream for sending by the RF section.

Prerequisites
   applications
      avr-gcc version 4.7 or higher
      avrdude - avr programmer

   The project requires the following libraries

   My quan physical quantities library - https://github.com/kwikius/quan-trunk
   
   The Arduino C/C++ source download http://arduino.cc/en/main/software

   Please note that though the project uses the Arduino source it doesnt use the Arduino environment since the project requires a newer version of gcc.
   The project also requires pre-existing external libraries which doesnt appear too be supported by the Arduino as far as I understand it.

   You can compile and build the project using gnu-make and the provided Makefile. You will need to hack the Makefile to change various directoroes and settings.
   See the Makefile for details.
   use "make upload" to upload to the board.

N.B. As it stands you change settings by rewriting the source code. 
This project is tailored to my hardware. You will need to tweak the files especially for the mixers.
The intent is to write your own mixer functions for your application.

Use https://github.com/kwikius/rctx_handset/blob/master/arduino/default_mixer.cpp as a template.
See https://github.com/kwikius/rctx_handset/blob/master/arduino/Tensor_V2_mixer.cpp for an example of a customised mixer
